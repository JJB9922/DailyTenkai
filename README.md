# DailyTenkai
A webapp that allows you to enter a location and receive a route that covers ~10k steps, door to door

# Screenshots

I have decided to include some screenshots since the google maps API will run out and break the site as soon as my free trial runs out!

Location picked, showing alternative routes. Location can be fuzzy found - here I just typed "Euston Stn Ldn" for Euston Station in London. I've also demonstrated something in a completely different locale - Shinjuku Station, Japan.

Error handling appears as a red text underneath the generate directions button.

Mobile view is handled differently to Desktop view to keep things... usable!
